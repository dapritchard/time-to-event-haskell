# time-to-event

Statistical routines for time-to-event data

## Goals

This is intended to be a learning experience for myself. If it ever grows to the
point where it becomes useful to others then the goals may change.

1. Gain experience writing Haskell packages
2. Learn and understand some of the key survival analysis method
   implementations.
